  digaritmo guitar duo consists of 2 vibrant musicians, Dirkie van Staden & 
  Rick Kleinhans. We are a fresh, unique and energetic duo from South Africa. 
  Our 'vibe' includes a variety of styles and a fusion of genres like Acoustic 
  Rock, Blues, Flamenco, Instrumental Pop, Reggae, Gypsy, Classical and Spanish.
  digaritmo can be loosly translated from Spanish to mean speak rhythm<br><br> 
  We have a lot of exiting upcoming projects after being finalists at the Yamaha 
  Young Talent Competition in 2010 and performing 3 shows at the 2011 KKNK. 
  We are currently working on our debut album (Awaken), which will be released 
  at the end of 2011. <br><br> Our show includes mostly original compositions as well as 
  arrangements of popular music from artists like Rodrigo & Gabriela and music 
  from the famous film scores of - "Desperado" & "Once upon a time in Mexico". 
  <br><br> This website is currently under construction.  <br>
